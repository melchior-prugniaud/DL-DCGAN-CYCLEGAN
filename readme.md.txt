Generative Adversarial Networks and Cycle-GAN
Generative Adversarial Networks are neural network architectures trained to produce a generative models for images, that is a sampling mechanism that allows you to produce images from a code. In this assignment, after a short bibliographical review in which you will summarize two papers: the DC-GAN and the Wasserstein GAN (ignore the “math-y” theoretical results, focus on the equations/definitions) papers, you will consider a more advanced architecture that combines two GANs and which can be used to “translate” images with different characteristics, the cycleGAN. I give you two choices: either use this detailed walk-through to an assignment, or do it yourselves. In both cases, and in order to keep things simple, I will ask you to translate from the MNIST dataset to the USPS dataset.
